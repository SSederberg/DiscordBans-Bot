## About DiscordBans-Bot
DiscordBans is a ban management system designed for the DiscordApp platform.
The "Bot" portion of this system is the Discord-end done by a bot.

## Public Usage
At this time, because of being early in its development cycle, DiscordBans is not available
for public usage. There are similar solutions available that can be found with a simple Google search.

Documentation regarding how to use the bot will come when the project goes into alpha.
